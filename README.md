I am Rohan, I am studying Computer Science at Sonarga University. 
In addition to studying, I like to do teamwork, like cycling somewhere together or being someone's travel guide.
My best quality is to be able to identify my weaknesses and turn them into strengths.
I like to work and think of other people's work as my own, so everyone is satisfied with my work. 
If I am told that "Rohan you do the work for me", I do it with the utmost cooperation. 
That's all there is to say about me, thank you for reading everything.
